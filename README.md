# GitHub Actions from Zero


This repository demonstrates core GitHub Actions features without any app code:


- Hello workflow with artifacts and context
- Matrix build + cross‑job artifact download
- Cache demo with conditional seeding
- Secrets usage and optional environment approvals
- A tiny local composite action (`./.github/actions/say-hello`)


Each workflow is self‑documented line‑by‑line in the YAML files.
